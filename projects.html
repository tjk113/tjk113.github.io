        <h2>## <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tjk113/GemSharp">GemSharp</a> - <em>a basic terminal Gemini client</em></h2>
        <p>I've written about Gemini <a target="_blank" href="https://tjk113.github.io/posts/2_gemsharp.html">before</a>, so I won't reiterate my interest in the protocol here. I decided to use C# for this project at the suggestion of a friend, and have found it to be quite a nice language. Being tied into the Microsoft ecosystem doesn't bother me too much, as I'm primarily a Windows user anyway (and am familiar with the occasional horror that is Visual Studio). Gemini is a simple protocol by design, so the networking code was quite straightforward. Hand-writing a TUI, on the other hand, has been yet another <em>enlightening</em> experience, to say the least.</p>
        <h2>## <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tjk113/tilda">tilda</a> - <em>a C-like general purpose programming language</em></h2>
        <p>I enjoy programming in a variety of languages (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tjk113">my GitHub</a> serves as evidence). Couple that with an innate interest in understanding what's going on "behind the scenes," and I was bound to try writing my own programming language sooner or later. I've been following the book <em><a target="_blank" href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></em> by Robert Nystrom, which has been a fantastic guide through language development. I've gained a lot of C++ experience in writing my interpreter (for better or worse), because I'm not a fan of the book's implementation language of Java. One day I'd like to write a native compiler for it (or another language).</p>
